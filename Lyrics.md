It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew all the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here
Talking to you about another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong and what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn into a bond and that bond will never be broken and the love
will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first then the line
Will never be crossed established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what
We reach so remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take will always lead you home
Hoo~
It's been a long day without you my friend

When I see you again, see you again
When I see you again

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars, yeah we'll be counting stars
I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and you shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I just doing what we're told
I~ feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
I~ feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we cou
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old，but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told
I~ feel something so wrong
By Doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned
Take that money

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I've learned
Take that money

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

You were the shadow to my life
Did you feel us
Another start
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Was it all in my fantasy
Where are you now
Were you only imaginary
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost I'm faded
These shallow waters never met
What I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
Alive
Where are you now
Where are you now
Under the bright
But faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now
Where are you now
Another dream
Another dream
Another dream
Another dream
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me
I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost I'm faded

At break of day
In hope we rise
We speak your name
We lift our eyes
Tune our hearts
Into Your beat
Where we walk
There You'll be
With fire in our eyes
Our lives, a light
Your love untamed
It's blazing out
The streets will glow
Forever bright
Your glory is breaking through the night
You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side
In my life
Shining through me everyday
You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side
In my life
Shining through me everyday!
You wake within me, wake within me
You're in my heart forever
You wake within me, wake within me
You're in my heart forever!
With fire in our eyes
Our lives, a light
Your love untamed
It's blazing out
Streets will glow
Forever bright
Your glory is breaking through the night
You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side
In my life
Shining through me everyday
You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side
In my life
Shining through me everyday!
You wake within me
Wake within me
You're in my heart forever
You wake within me
Wake within me
You're in my heart forever
Forever, forever, forever

What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through ,all the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look at you and I run right back to you
You cross that line and it's time to say F you
What's the point in saying that when you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back, but shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you and that's that
Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If we just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal
All these firing shots and making ground
It's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go
Cause when it all falls down, then whatever
When it don't work out for the better
If we just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down, when it all falls down
I'll be fine
I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine
I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine-ine-ine
I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine-ine-ine
I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine-ine-ine
I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine
Cause when it all falls down, then whatever (Then whatever, babe)
When it don't work out for the better (For the better)
If we just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down (When it all, when it all)
When it all falls down (When it all falls down)
I'll be fine (Fine, fine, fine)
I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine (I'll be fine), and that's that

四点四十四灵魂蒸发  
理智掉了漆还在粉刷  
意识潜意识到底谁在说话   
对白交错没有文法  
追寻真理或安于现状
选择墨菲斯哪颗药丸
红蓝的抉择何必挣扎
我色盲只能装傻
想安静却静不下来
夜色精彩
醉人徘徊
他的轮廓记不起来
油门一踩
留下的黑白只为世人难以忘怀
这是什么现象
对 是前所未见乱象
别说我在想像
快 将我从崖上推下
反射的我被镜子拘押
他说他认输想要回家
右脑吵左脑谁是真假 
矛与盾争锋没有时差
心里这场雨倾盆而下
撑伞是否算活在当下
哪片草坪被任意践踏 
蹲下一看 我在脚下
抓着神智醒不过来 
过分期待 是我活该
精疲力竭喊破声带 
只能放开
重力加速度 路人只看精彩
我愤世但我 说不出来
我不想这样
这是什么现象
对 是前所未见乱象
别说我在想像
快 将我从崖上推下
还有多久 才过四点四十四
拿起肘机电源剩四十四
抬头 红灯 也剩下四十四
几月 几号 四月四十四
是 不是不是 
四 不四不四
视 不视不视 
四 不四不四
识 不识不识 
四 不四不四
试 不试不试 
四 不四不四不四不四
是 不是不是 
四 不四不四
视 不视不视 
四 不四不四
识 不识不识 
四 不四不四
试 不试不试 
是不三不四

In the middle of the night
When our hopes and fears collide  
In the midst of all goodbyes  
Where all human beings lie  
Against another lie  
Whisper broken promises 
There we hide  
Try to make it seem alright  
What goes around again  
We'd be running from the pain  
Finding shelter in the rain  
Lovers straying seasons changing  
Strangers to lovers  
What comes around again  
You'd fall asleep in my embrace  
Steal a kiss on your little face  
Would have always been that way  
But hey  
You're never coming back  
Never coming back  
I'll be rated anyway  
I'll be rated anyway  
Until the day  
In the middle of the night  
Lonely souls travel in time  
Familiar hearts start to entwine  
We imagine what we'll find  
In another life  
Whisper broken promises  
There we hide  
Try to make it seem alright  
What goes around again  
We'd be running from the pain  
Finding shelter in the rain  
Lovers straying seasons changing  
Strangers to lovers  
What comes around again  
You'd fall asleep in my embrace  
Steal a kiss on your little face  
Would have always been that way  
But hey  
You're never coming back  
Never coming back  
I'll be waiting anyway  
I'll be waiting anyway  
Till it comes around again  
We'd be playing in the sand  
Holding hands just one last chance  
No more hurts no more goodbyes  
We'd dance  
We're never going back  
Never turning back  
Won't you wait with me anyway  
Won't you wait with me anyway  
Until the day  
What comes around goes around  
What goes around comes around
Until the day

I feel the pain and anger, wicked monster, losin' control
愤怒源自苦弱邪恶生物挣脱枷锁
秋风吹过农田麦浪稻花是真的很香
I'm ready for a battle, wakened shadow, blood on my soul
步入硝烟战火阴影苏醒金血入魄
黑色土地从古至今养育着咱的爹娘
Burn it, burning it all, heavens, let them fall~ Haha
烧吧烧尽神国乐园已陨落哈哈
冬天，大雪飞扬，炕头，唠家常，哈哈哈
They taste of bitter ashes, littered plastic, crumblin away
痛饮死灰苦涩糟粕四散崩溃沉没
蓝蓝的天空看上去有白云飘荡
They glimpse the broken faces, devil racin', searching for faith
掠过面孔零落恶兽驰骋争向神堕
清澈的小河里面有河水在潺潺流淌
Crushing, crushing it all, shadows, watch them crawl~ Hahaha
撕破撕裂所有黑夜也跪我
吃那，酸菜血肠，人们，喜洋洋，哈哈哈
Creepin' up my brain
癫狂染意念
爱我大东北
Learnin' from my pain
苦痛中蔓延
家乡大东北
Baby watchin' it burn, send death to isolation
白夜烈日燎燃看孤身爆发耀斑
秧歌扭起来，大东北我的家乡
Oh watchin' it burn, ain't got no hesitation
厄焰狂乱看骄阳无畏崩坍
唢呐吹出来，我在这土生土长
Watchin' it burn, we're fallin' higher
越是粉碎（我）越要俯瞰
哥们相聚，必须整二两
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh~
I'll cast your dark intentions, convolution, never before
破纵横阴谋交错斩断混沌从未有过
我的老家就住在大东北的松花江上
I'll fight with skeletons, adrenaline, conviction in war
焚血骨血灰血肉激素迸射定罪战火
那里有满山遍野大豆玉米甜菜高粱
Terror, terror is near, I will shatter you all!
来吧恐怖压迫，碾碎这世末！
门口，种大白杨，我住，茅草房
Baby watchin' it burn, send death to isolation
白夜烈日燎燃看孤身爆发耀斑
秧歌扭起来，大东北我的家乡
Oh watchin' it burn, ain't got no hesitation
厄焰狂乱看骄阳无畏崩坍
唢呐吹出来，人们都喜气洋洋
Watchin' it burn, we're fallin' higher
越是粉碎（我）越要俯瞰
醉了月亮，暖了我心肠
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh~
Watchin' it burn! Oh watchin' it burn!
爆发耀斑无畏崩坍
我的家乡，在松花江上
Watchin' it burn!
越是粉碎
我的家乡，松花江上，松花江上
Watchin' it burn!
越要俯瞰
松花江上，松花江上，是我的家乡
Like glass that shattered, reaching through the darkness
琉璃成飞灰偏要刺破黑夜
每年的冬天，鹅毛大雪飞扬
Voices trailing fires, echo of desires
呼声牵动残焰自由渴念不歇
热热的炕头上，我们唠唠家常
A world of silence, sound of Death's parading
沉默这世界末日狂欢不灭
抬头仰望，天上白云飘荡
Phantoms in the shadow, softly waiting…
直到往日旧念为我阖眼
低头俯瞰远方，潺潺流淌
I'm tearin' it down! Embrace the detonation
撕碎金血怒绽拥抱我爆裂璀璨
吃酸菜血肠，哥们必须整二两
Burnin' it loud! Cravin' our damn creation
三千万转响彻这罪业回环
唢呐吹响，吹出家乡的模样
Breakin' the chain! I'm reachin' for ya
锁链挣断（我）向你之畔
醉了月亮，暖了我心肠
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah!!
Shout till the end! This blaze is my salvation!
咆哮直至终焉此身为救世烈焰
绿水青山，大东北我的家乡
Sword in the wind! I strike without damnation!
侵晨作剑再创世无毁信念
松花江上，我在这土生土长
Shatter the skies! No fate, no king, no god!
破晓星天轮回命运乌有
贼拉拉爱，东北，麦浪，家乡
Fall to my name!
向我俯首！
我的家乡！
Fall to my name!
向我俯首！
我的家乡！
Fall to my name!
向我俯首！
我的家乡！
Fall to my name!
向我俯首！
我的家乡！
Fall to my name!
向我俯首！
我的家乡！
Fall to my name!
向我俯首！
我的家乡！
… my name!
向我
家乡！
Fall to my name!
向我俯首！
我的家乡！

微凉的晨露沾湿黑礼服
石板路有雾 父在低诉
无奈的觉悟 只能更残酷
一切都为了通往圣堂的路
吹不散的雾 隐没了意图
谁轻柔踱步 停住
还来不及哭
穿过的子弹就带走温度
我们每个人都有罪
犯着不同的罪
我能决定谁对
谁又该要沉睡
争论不能解决
在永无止境的夜
关掉你的嘴
唯一的恩惠
后悔也无路可退
以父之名判决
那感觉没有适合字汇
就像边笑边掉泪
凝视着完全的黑
阻挡悲剧蔓延的悲剧会让我沉醉
低头亲吻我的左手
换取被宽恕的承诺
老旧管风琴在角落
一直一直一直伴奏
黑色帘幕被风吹动
阳光无言地穿透
洒向那群被我驯服后的兽
沉默地喊叫 沉默地喊叫
孤单开始发酵
不停对着我嘲笑
回忆逐渐延烧
曾经纯真的画面
残忍的温柔出现
脆弱时间到
我们一起来祷告
仁慈的父我已坠入
请原谅我的自负
Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya
没人能说没人可说
好难承受
荣耀的背后刻着一道孤独
Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya
闭上双眼我又看见
当年那梦的画面
天空是蒙蒙的雾
Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya
父亲牵着我的双手
轻轻走过
清晨那安安静静的石板路
Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya
Pie Jesu
Qui tollis peccata
Dona eis requiem
低头亲吻我的左手
换取被宽恕的承诺
老旧管风琴在角落
一直一直一直伴奏
黑色帘幕被风吹动
阳光无言地穿透
洒向那群被我驯服后的兽
沉默地喊叫 沉默地喊叫
孤单开始发酵
不停对着我嘲笑
回忆逐渐延烧
曾经纯真的画面
残忍地温柔出现
脆弱时间到
我们一起来祷告
仁慈的父我已坠入
看不见罪的国度
请原谅我的自负
Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya
没人能说没人可说
好难承受
荣耀的背后刻着一道孤独
Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya
仁慈的父 我已坠入
看不见罪的国度
请原谅我 我的自负
刻着一道孤独
仁慈的父我已坠入
看不见罪的国度
请原谅我的自负
Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya
没人能说没人可说
好难承受
荣耀的背后刻着一道孤独
Ah ya ya check it check it ah ya
斑驳的家徽 擦拭了一夜
孤独的光辉 才懂的感觉
烛光 不 不 停的摇晃
猫头鹰在窗棂上
对着远方眺望
通向大厅的长廊
一样 说不出的沧桑
没有喧嚣 只有宁静围绕
我 慢慢睡着
天刚刚破晓

曾许下心愿  
等待你的出现  
褪色的秋千  
有本书会纪念  
我循着时间  
捡起梦的照片  
童话还没有兑现  
却需要说再见  
如果有一天  
岁月晕开书页  
请把我模糊的字迹当作笑脸  
很久前  
想象今天画面  
哭着笑着告别  
陌生的情节  
熟悉的侧脸都重叠 
oh~
出发前  
无数星光缱绻  
有回忆落在指尖  
当世界向前  
我会在原地流连  
当漪涟  
一滴一点出现  
轻轻去向天边  
不管多遥远  
都是追不上的思念  
oh~
会不会  
可能还能相见  
再回头只看一眼  
当漪涟
消散万千不见  
永恒和瞬间都被爱意成全
我的明天叫做昨天 
Hoo~
要相信
浪漫一如初见
请笑着向我道别
最后这一页
就让它无言
我会在扉页
等待你续写起点
